/* Question 5: Incremental Evaluation, Redux (5 + 8 + 7 = 20 points)

   Please refer back to Homework 3, Question 3.

   Another situation where both DAGs and incremental evaluation are important
   are build systems, such as Make. Imagine you are developing a large C
   program, and you change a single file foo.c. The compiler needs to recompile
   not just foo.c, but also all of the other files whose compilation
   transitively depended on it. We can certainly determine which files need
   recompiling, and in what order, in a manner similar to what you did in HW3.
   However, as we will discover in this question, domain specific languages such
   as Datalog often provide a much more convenient way to express these
   computations. As a challenge, my reference solution to this whole question
   contains just 9 lines of Datalog code. :)

   We provide:

   1. A two column input relation, Deps, consisting of those tuples (x, y) such
      that the compilation of file y depends on the result of compiling file x.
   2. A one column input relation, Changed, indicating files which have been
      changed by the user.

   Compute a two column output relation, OrderlessFullRecompile, consisting of
   files x which need to be recompiled. We add the prefix Orderless because this
   relation doesn't tell us in what order to do this recompilation. Feel free to
   define any auxiliary relations as needed. */

.type file <: symbol

.decl Deps(f1: file, f2: file)

.decl Changed(f: file)

.decl OrderlessFullRecompile(f: file)
.output OrderlessFullRecompile

// the changed file
OrderlessFullRecompile(x) :- Changed(x).
// direct dependency
OrderlessFullRecompile(y) :- Changed(x), Deps(x,y).
// dependency is in OrderlessFullRecompile
OrderlessFullRecompile(y) :- OrderlessFullRecompile(x), Deps(x,y).


/* For example, if: */
Deps("A1", "B1").
Deps("A1", "A2").
Deps("B1", "C1").
Deps("B1", "B2").
Deps("C1", "C2").
Deps("A2", "B2").
Deps("A2", "A3").
Deps("B2", "C2").
Deps("B2", "B3").
Deps("C2", "C3").
Deps("A3", "B3").
Deps("B3", "C3").

/* and file A2 is changed: */
Changed("A2").

/* then the set of files { A2, B2, C2, A3, B3, C3 } need recompilation. */



/* We now determine the order in which to recompile these files. For this, we
   will assign each such file f with an iteration number n in which it needs to
   be recompiled. The idea is that each file is recompiled in an iteration
   strictly larger than all of its parents. We will store this data in a
   two-column output relation FullRecompile.

   Note that each f in OrderlessFullRecompile must appear in exactly one tuple
   (f, n) of FullRecompile. You may assign multiple files to be recompiled in
   the same iteration number. You may assume that Deps describes a DAG, and may
   compute any other relations as needed. */

.decl FullRecompile(f: file, n: number)
.output FullRecompile

// first assign 0 to all files with no dependencies
FullRecompile(x,0) :- !Deps(y,x).

// if all it's dependecies are in FullRecompile, then add one to max iteration
FullRecompile(x, (dmax+1)) :- Deps(y,x), dmax = max d: FullRecompile(y, d).

/* For example, if we have FullRecompile("A2", na2) and
   FullRecompile("B2", nb2), then na2 < nb2, since the file B2 depends on file
   A1. One possible output---but certainly not the only possibility---is the
   following:

     ---------------
     FullRecompile
     f	n
     ===============
     A2	0
     B2	1
     C2	2
     A3	1
     B3	2
     C3	3
     =============== */

/* The prefix Full in FullRecompile indicates that we are recompiling the whole
   project. Users are often only interested in recompiling a specific file, or
   rebuild the project in a certain configuration, so one may not need to
   recompile all files. We provide the files of interest to the user in a
   one-column input relation, Target.

   Write a Datalog program that determines which files need recompilation, and
   in what order, assuming this target. We will store the results in a file
   named PartialRecompile. This is a two-column relation, consisting of the file
   that needs recompilation, and the iteration number in which it needs to be
   recompiled. */

.decl Target(f: file)

.decl PartialRecompile(f: file, n: number)
.output PartialRecompile

// 1. Find all files that need to be recomputed
.decl OrderlessPartialRecompile(f: file)
OrderlessPartialRecompile(x) :- Target(x).
OrderlessPartialRecompile(y) :- Target(x), Deps(y,x).
OrderlessPartialRecompile(y) :- OrderlessPartialRecompile(x), Deps(y,x).

// 2. Order the list OrderlessPartialRecompile
// all files with no dependecies in OrderlessPartialRecompile will have a 0
PartialRecompile(x,0) :- OrderlessPartialRecompile(x), !Deps(y,x).
// files with dependecies on OrderlessPartialRecompile will be recompiled when
// all it's dependecies are recompiled.
PartialRecompile(y, (dm+1)) :- Deps(x,y), OrderlessPartialRecompile(x), 
                               dm = max n: PartialRecompile(x,n).


Target("B3").

/* In this case, we would need to recompile { A2, B2, A3, B3 }. Note that the
   files { C2, C3 } do not need to be recompiled even though their dependencies
   have changed. */
